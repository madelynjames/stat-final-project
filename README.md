# stat-final-project
My final project is analizing the show "Gilmore Girls". I gathered my data by watching a few episodes from each season and recording the emotion I felt, the effort they put into it and if it was mostly women led. Then I found data on what season it was, when it was published, and the credit rating. I sampled this by watching each episode and thinking deep into each of the observations. 
I used a convience sample. I chose Gilmore Girls as my unit of analysis because I am very familiar with the show and have watched it multiple times.
Year_published is the year the episode was released, season_show is the season that the episode was released into, women_led is weather the episode was mainly based around the women's experiences (0= no, 1= yes), emotion is the was i felt when watching the episode and the emotion the episode made you feel (happy, stressed, sad), effort is the ammount on a scale from 0-100 that I felt they put into the episode, and credit_rating is the rating the episode was given by people (excellent, good, fair, bad). 
I found the season, credit rating, and year published by doing research on each episode. The effort, emotion, and if it was women led were all observations that I gathered from watching each episode. I decided to measure these concepts because some were quantitative and some were qualitiative, they were also unquie to measure.
